# SED
Calculate and plot spectral energy distribution of main-sequence stars with additional option of blackbody/greybody calculation from mid-IR excess
The code is still under development for general use.

Main run program is plot_sed.py

sed.py hosts all logistical tools to help calculate the SED: Filter profile management, magnitude/flux conversion,  photosphere generation, etc.

More updates underway in the near future.

Please message me for any comments on improvement or features anyone would like to see.

NextGen and Kurucz photosphere models are currently the only ones incorporated into code. 

Ipython Notebook for testing is under development.
